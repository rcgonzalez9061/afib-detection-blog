    "So I recently bought an Apple Watch. It was on sale for a pretty good deal and I've been wanting one for quite a while, so I just had to get it. Like I normally do with all of my recently purchased gadgets, I played around with it in the middle of the night to figure out all of its features. This led to me discovering the ECG feature which intrigued me, so I set out to recreate a similar system to detect Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) like Apple's implementation does. \n",

    "The first thing I had to do was to source a good ECG dataset. Luckily, I quickly found the [MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database](https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/). It contains annotated ECG data from 23 unique patients each with two simultaneous 10 hour ECG signals. The annotations detailing the rythym at a given time are given in a record's `.atr` files. There are 4 different types of annotations for hearth rythyms: Atrial Fibrilation (AFIB), Atrial Flutter (AFL), AV Junction (J), and \"all other rythyms\" (N). The dataset mostly captures AFIB and N rythyms while AFL and J only make up around 1% of the data."

We can expect banding as the result of the harmonics produced by the beat rythym. The sharpness of this banding is likely a result of the variance in each label. AFL and J will have low variance due to the limited number of samples available for them while AFIB and N have higher variance since they have a larger sample pool. Thus, AFL and J appear \"sharper\" while AFIB and N are more \"fuzzy\".\n",

N has slightly more sample availability than AFIB, having about 20% more data available by duration and appearing in more unique occasions that last longer than 5 seconds. Still, AFIB appears to have more variance making it hard to distinguish any clear harmonics. Meanwhile, N has some pretty evident harmonic banding. \n",

If this is the case, then I theorize that N's appearance in this plot will become more fuzzy as I increase the sample size for each class. I tested this at two other sample sizes. At 1,000, I observed slightly more variance in both N and AFIB, but harmonic banding remained distinguishable in N. At 10,000 there was no noticable difference than that at the 1,000 level. From this experiment, I can't conclusively say that this isn't the case.\n",

Then I discarded any occurances less than 30s (3x the expected length) and split each occurance into 3 smaller, equally-sized signals and randomly one-to-one mapped each to a fold. From here, the subsamples were further split into 10 second slices with a 50% overlap between each, discarding any excess. This resulted in 54,989 samples (22,020 AFIB, 32,969 N) per fold. \n",

However, the exact architecture of a CNN can vary widely so I've compared various designs in this project.
